# Dendrogram_packages

This folder is prepared to keep basic dendrogram scripts which will be useful for the application of this module on star forming clumps. These files are:
  1. 3d_dendro.py is useful to use 3d spectral data cube and make dendrograms out of them. It also provides an interactive plot to            relate the flow chart with the emission plot obtained from the sky.
  2. 3d_fil_stat.py helps to get the filament statistics from the dendrogram chart. This will include filaments sizes, width, flux            values etc.
  3. 3d_plotting_stat_over_dendo.py is to make contours of the clumps identified by the dendrogram routine over the 3d emission plot.
  4. Mass, column density calculation can also be done using one of the remaining files. We can also refer to jupyter notebook                using_dendrogram_to_get_all.ipynb to get all these information compiled in one place. Since my jupyter notebook was not working, I      have converted these .ipynb files into .py files.
